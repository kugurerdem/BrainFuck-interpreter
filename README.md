# About this Project

The main goal of this project is to come up with an IDE that allows users to write BrainFuck code more easily with some extra features and see the code working simultaniously (This way, it will be easier to track the code).

# What is BrainFuck

BrainFuck is a Turing Complete programming language. It has 8 keywords in it, and with these keywords, despite of its' complexity theoretically every program can be written with infinite memory.

# To-Do List

- Implement parser in a more flexible way so code will become more easier to develop.
- Implement new notation to BrainFuck, for example instead of writing +++++, write 5+. Instead of writing >>> write 3> etc.
- Develop a basic text editor and IDE for BrainFuck.
