# What is BrainFuck

BrainFuck is a Turing Complete programming language. It has 8 keywords in it, and with these keywords, despite of its' complexity theoretically every program can be written with infinite memory.

# Where is the Interpreter?

Interpreter is basically a class in this folder. You should be able to interprete any BrainFuck code within any class simply creating an instance for Interpreter class. It has two parameters, first parameter is the code itself and second parameter is cell_number. 

# To-Do List

- Implement parser in a more flexible way so code will become more easier to develop.
- Implement new notation to BrainFuck, for example instead of writing +++++, write 5+. Instead of writing >>> write 3> etc.
- Develop a basic text editor and IDE for BrainFuck.
